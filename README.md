# Project Your Own Tax Calculator



### The main languages I used:

####  JavaScript + ES6 + React.js 



#### Online Demo URL:

#### http://taxcalculator.tianlinweb.com/



#### project introduction:

1) using the react framework's new  feature 'hook' and function component.

2) using react-spring library to create animations.

3) using Model-View-Controller architecture to separate codes.

â€‹		data calculating module, view, and control modules are separated.

4) the common components such as user input form, and background picture are reusable. which makes code more easy to maintenance and handover to other developers.

Moreover, each complex code blog was commented by the simple worlds.



#### Extra implementation:

1)   using 'useEffect ' hook to simulates login interception function:

 For example, user could only access to the results page after they directed from calculate page,

 if user input the result page's URL directly, this project would intercept this and redirect to calculate page.



2)using CANVA to design a new active background image, which looks better.



3)Error message prompt:

if user does not input all the required information's in calculate page, the system would prompt error alert and remind the user what they has missed.
